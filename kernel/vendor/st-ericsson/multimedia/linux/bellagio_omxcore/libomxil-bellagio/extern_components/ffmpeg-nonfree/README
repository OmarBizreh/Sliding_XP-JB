The FFMpeg non-free library based OpenMAX component.

To compile the component execute:

autoreconf -i -f
./configure --prefix=$INSTALL_DIR_PATH
make
make install


FFMPEG issue:

In order to use this component the ffmpeg library should be
 manually compiled with the following options:

./configure --enable-shared --enable-gpl --enable-nonfree  --enable-swscale --enable-libamr-nb --enable-libvorbis

The resulting library is not redistributable at all.
These components are released for examples purposes.
